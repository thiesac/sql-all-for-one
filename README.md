# SQL All For One Project

This project was completed as part of my coursework at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). The goal of the project was to apply various database concepts by normalizing data from unnormalized spreadsheets, populating a database, and executing SQL queries to extract specific information.

## Project Tasks

### Part 1: Normalize SpotifyClone Tables
- Normalized the data in the "SpotifyClone" spreadsheet.
- Defined business rules for the database.

### Part 2: Create Database Tables
- Created a database named "SpotifyClone."
- Provided SQL queries to create normalized tables based on business rules.
- Populated the tables with data from the spreadsheet.
- Adjusted the "desafio1.json" configuration file to map table and column information for automated evaluation.

### Challenge 2
- Created a SQL query to display the total number of songs, artists, and albums.
- Used table joins or sub-queries to achieve the desired result.

### Challenge 3
- Created a SQL query to display user names, the number of songs listened to, and the total minutes listened.
- Grouped results by user name and sorted them alphabetically.

### Challenge 4
- Created a SQL query to identify active users starting from 2021 based on playback history.
- Displayed user names and their status (active/inactive) in alphabetical order.

### Challenge 5
- Created a SQL query to find the two most played songs.
- Displayed song names and the number of listeners.
- Sorted results by playback count and then alphabetically.

### Challenge 6
- Calculated various financial metrics related to user plans.
- Displayed the minimum plan value, maximum plan value, average plan value, and total revenue.
- Rounded values to two decimal places.

### Challenge 7
- Created a SQL query to list albums produced by artists, sorted by the number of followers.
- Displayed artist names, album names, and follower counts.
- Sorted results by follower count, artist name, and album name.
